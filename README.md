# Greyhawk VM (ghvm)

A VM implementation in Rust, written for the Greyhawk programming
language.

However, the VM was also designed to execute any arbitrary language as
well.

## About the VM philosophy

* see doc/goals.md and doc/design.md

## Using ghvm

greyhawk-vm is available as both a rust library, and an executable to
execute code.
